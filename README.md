Customized dotfiles on top of thoughtbot/dotfiles

Also good to set up solarized colors for iTerm from:
https://github.com/altercation/solarized
And then install the color schemes into iTerm.
--> So much nicer...

The powerline fonts also need to be installed in iTerm:
https://github.com/powerline/fonts
in order for vim-airline to look decent.
